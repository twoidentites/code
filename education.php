    <h1>Our Education <br>Scheme</br></h1>
    <p>Opened in 1828 by ZSR (Zoological Society of Rigets)<br> Rigets Zoo is the world's oldest scientific zoo and the<br> brainchild of Sir Ben Dave Smith, who was also<br> renowned for founding Singapore. For almost 20 years<br> only fellows of the Society were allowed to access the Zoo<br> for scientific study, until the doors were opened to the public <br>in 1847 to help funding the gorilla statue at the entrance to<br> ZSR Rigets Zoo is a tribute to one of our most famous residents,<br> Guy. The Western lowland gorilla arrived at the Zoo on Guy<br> Fawkes Night, hence his name, and became something of a <br>celebrity, attracting thousands of visitors to the Zoo between <br>1947 and 1978. Despite Western lowland gorillas being the<br> world's largest primates, Guy was a gentle giant and would<br> cradle birds that had flown into his enclosure in his <br>hands before setting them free again.</p>
